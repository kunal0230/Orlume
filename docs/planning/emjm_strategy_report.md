## 📝 Motivation Letter Strategy

### For Each Program, Emphasize

**IMLEX**:
> "I built Orlume's 3D relighting system using depth-based normal estimation and real-time GPU lighting calculations — demonstrating practical understanding of imaging and light that I want to expand into XR research."

**IMAGING**:
> "Orlume integrates deep learning (depth estimation, segmentation) with real-time GPU pipelines for visual media processing. I'm excited to explore [Visual AI/Immersive] track to advance these capabilities."

**IPCV**:
> "As the developer of an open-source AI photo editor used by X users, I've hands-on experience with computer vision (depth estimation, segmentation), deep learning inference (TensorFlow.js, ONNX), and GPU-accelerated image processing. IPCV would provide the theoretical foundation to push these systems further."

## 📹 Motivation Video Strategy (IMLEX)

Since IMLEX accepts optional motivation videos:

1. **Screen recording of Orlume** (30 sec)
   - Show 3D relighting in action
   - Demonstrate depth estimation

2. **Your face explaining** (60 sec)
   - "I built this to understand imaging and light"
   - "I want to research [specific topic]"

3. **Future vision** (30 sec)
   - What you want to build next
   - How the program helps

## 📊 Your Competitive Advantage

| Typical Applicant | You with Orlume |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| "I studied image processing" | "I built a production image processing pipeline" |
| "I know TensorFlow" | "I deployed ML models in browser with ONNX & TF.js" |
| "I'm interested in VR" | "I implemented 3D relighting with depth estimation" |
| "I want to learn GPU programming" | "I wrote WebGL2 shaders for real-time rendering" |

**Your open-source project is your portfolio. The selection committee can actually run it.**

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

1. **Your project already covers 70% of what these programs teach** — position it that way
2. **Add 2-3 high-impact features** before applications close
3. **Create documentation that shows academic awareness**
4. **In interviews, demo Orlume live** — nothing beats showing real work

Good luck! 🚀
