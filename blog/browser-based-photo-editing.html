            <h1 class="article-title">The Future of Browser-Based Photo Editing: WebGPU, AI, and Beyond</h1>
            <p class="article-subtitle">How modern web technologies are enabling professional-grade photo editing
                without downloads or installations.</p>
        </header>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p class="article-lead">For decades, professional photo editing meant expensive desktop software, powerful
                hardware, and complicated installations. But the landscape is changing rapidly. With WebGPU, on-device
                AI, and modern browser capabilities, we're entering an era where your browser is as powerful as any
                desktop application.</p>

            <h2>The Limitations of Traditional Web Editors</h2>
            <p>Early online photo editors were severely limited. Without access to GPU acceleration, they relied on slow
                JavaScript processing. Complex operations took seconds or minutes. Real-time previews were impossible.
                Users accepted these limitations because the convenience of browser-based tools outweighed the
                performance penalties.</p>

            <p>Some tools worked around this by uploading images to servers for processing. This introduced privacy
                concerns, required internet connectivity, and added latency to every operation. It was a compromise, not
                a solution.</p>

            <h2>Enter WebGPU: GPU Power in the Browser</h2>
            <p>WebGPU is a game-changer. It provides web applications with direct access to modern GPU hardware — the
                same chips that power desktop graphics applications and AI workloads. For photo editing, this means:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-time image processing:</strong> Apply filters, adjustments, and effects instantaneously
                </li>
                <li><strong>Large image support:</strong> Edit high-resolution photos without lag</li>
                <li><strong>AI inference:</strong> Run sophisticated neural networks directly in the browser</li>
                <li><strong>Parallel processing:</strong> Apply multiple effects simultaneously</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At Orlume, we utilize WebGPU to deliver features that were previously impossible in browsers. Our 3D
                relighting, background removal, and AI upscaling all run on your device's GPU, providing instant results
                without compromising your privacy.</p>

            <h2>On-Device AI: Power Without Privacy Compromise</h2>
            <p>The AI revolution brought powerful image editing capabilities — but initially, they required cloud
                processing. Your photos would be uploaded, processed on remote servers, and returned. This creates
                obvious privacy concerns, especially for sensitive personal or professional images.</p>

            <p>Modern browser technologies enable on-device AI inference. Using frameworks like ONNX Runtime Web and
                TensorFlow.js, we can run sophisticated neural networks entirely in your browser. Your photos never
                leave your device.</p>

            <h3>What This Means for You</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complete privacy:</strong> Your images are processed locally, never uploaded</li>
                <li><strong>Works offline:</strong> Once loaded, the app functions without internet</li>
                <li><strong>No account required:</strong> No sign-ups, no tracking, just editing</li>
                <li><strong>Instant processing:</strong> No upload/download latency</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Technology Stack Behind Orlume</h2>

            <h3>Depth Estimation for 3D Relighting</h3>
            <p>Our flagship 3D relighting feature uses monocular depth estimation — predicting 3D structure from a
                single 2D image. We run a transformer-based model that analyzes your photo and generates a detailed
                depth map. This enables realistic lighting simulation that understands the geometry of faces, objects,
                and environments.</p>

            <h3>Semantic Segmentation for Background Removal</h3>
            <p>Background removal uses a U-Net architecture trained on millions of images. The model classifies each
                pixel as foreground or background, with special attention to challenging edges like hair, fur, and
                semi-transparent elements. Edge refinement algorithms then smooth the mask for professional results.</p>

            <h3>Super-Resolution for Upscaling</h3>
            <p>Our upscaling uses a neural network trained on paired low/high-resolution images. It learns to predict
                missing details, reconstructing textures and sharpening edges as it increases resolution. The result is
                enlargement that adds detail rather than just blurring.</p>

            <h2>What's Next for Browser-Based Editing</h2>
            <p>The capabilities we're seeing today are just the beginning. As hardware improves and web standards
                evolve, expect:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Larger AI models:</strong> More sophisticated models will enable even more powerful features
                </li>
                <li><strong>Video editing:</strong> The same techniques will extend to video processing</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative editing:</strong> Real-time multi-user editing in the browser</li>
                <li><strong>AR integration:</strong> Combining photo editing with augmented reality previews</li>
            </ul>
