        <div class="article-content">
            <p class="article-lead">Lighting is everything in photography. It separates amateur snapshots from
                professional portraits. But what if you could add professional lighting to any photo, after it's already
                been taken? That's exactly what Orlume's 3D relighting does.</p>

            <h2>What is 3D Relighting?</h2>
            <p>3D relighting is an AI-powered technique that analyzes the depth and structure of your photo, then
                simulates how light would realistically interact with the scene. Unlike simple brightness adjustments or
                overlay effects, 3D relighting understands that a nose casts a shadow, that cheekbones catch highlights,
                and that hair creates complex light patterns.</p>

            <p>Our neural depth estimation model processes your image to create a detailed 3D map. When you place a
                virtual light source, we calculate how that light would illuminate every surface, accounting for angles,
                distances, and material properties.</p>

            <h2>How to Use 3D Relighting in Orlume</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Upload Your Image</h3>
            <p>Open the <a href="/editor">Orlume Editor</a> and upload your photo. You can drag and drop, paste from
                clipboard, or click to browse. Orlume supports JPG, PNG, and WebP files up to 50MB.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Activate the 3D Relight Tool</h3>
            <p>In the left toolbar, click the lightbulb icon to activate 3D relighting mode. You'll see an overlay
                indicating the tool is active and ready for light placement.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Position Your Light Source</h3>
            <p>Click anywhere on your image to place the virtual light source. A glowing indicator shows the light's
                position. Drag it around to see how different positions affect the lighting in real-time.</p>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> For portraits, try positioning the light at a 45-degree angle above and to the
                side of the subject. This creates classic "Rembrandt lighting" with a pleasing triangle of light on the
                shadowed cheek.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Adjust Light Properties</h3>
            <p>Use the control panel to fine-tune your lighting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intensity:</strong> Controls how bright the light appears. Higher values create more
                    dramatic contrast.</li>
                <li><strong>Direction:</strong> Rotates the light source around your subject for different angles.</li>
                <li><strong>Softness:</strong> Determines how sharp or diffused the shadows are. Soft light is
                    flattering for portraits; hard light creates drama.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Temperature:</strong> Shift between warm (golden) and cool (blue) lighting to match
                    your mood.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 5: Layer Multiple Lights</h3>
            <p>For complex lighting setups, you can add multiple light sources. This is perfect for creating
                professional three-point lighting with a key light, fill light, and rim light.</p>

            <h2>Best Use Cases for 3D Relighting</h2>

            <h3>Portrait Enhancement</h3>
            <p>Add rim lighting to separate your subject from the background. Fill in harsh shadows from midday sun.
                Create studio-quality lighting from outdoor snapshots.</p>

            <h3>Product Photography</h3>
            <p>Highlight product features with strategic lighting. Create consistent lighting across multiple product
                shots. Add drama to flat e-commerce images.</p>

            <h3>Creative Effects</h3>
            <p>Create neon-colored lighting for cyberpunk aesthetics. Add dramatic single-source lighting for film noir
                effects. Simulate golden hour lighting at any time of day.</p>

            <h2>The Technology Behind 3D Relighting</h2>
            <p>Orlume's relighting uses a combination of monocular depth estimation (predicting 3D structure from a
                single 2D image) and physically-based rendering. Our AI model was trained on millions of images with
                known lighting conditions, learning to predict how surfaces reflect and absorb light.</p>

            <p>All processing happens directly in your browser using WebGPU acceleration. Your photos are never uploaded
                to our servers, ensuring complete privacy while delivering real-time performance.</p>

            <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
            <p>The best way to understand 3D relighting is to try it. <a href="/editor?tool=3d">Open the Orlume
